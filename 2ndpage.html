    <h1> Interest in IT </h1>
    <p>
    Originally I wanted to be a scientist in order to further progress the world and discover new advancements for humanity. However after struggle in V.C.E I had to reconsider my careers options. It was then that I considered I.T, as I was doing so well that I decided to pursue it. 
This wasn’t just solely based on luck as I had continuous dedication through trial and error from learning from my mistakes in my studies in Information Technology, being attentive in class and trying to understand concepts that I didn’t understand.This was then furnished by my own personal goals and my uncle. Firstly through my passion through gaming I had heard that it was financially better to build a PC so I decided to do some research into the hardware of computers. My uncle then inspired me by telling me on how he was a freelance who travelled to Singapore for a company which sounded really enticing. 

I choose to come to RMIT a I heard through various university students that I meet that RMIT was the place that specializes in information technology. Also on occasional visits to the State Library of Victoria when I visited to study and take in the vibrant atmosphere of the city I would notice that RMIT was right next to it and I figured that it would be a great place to study as I would not only enjoy travelling to uni but also gain access to great restaurants.

What I expect to learn during my studies is various techniques on how to program various softwares and programs as well as how to effectively organise databases. However I will also learn how to effectively network between students and organisations while also balancing between socialisation and assignments.
